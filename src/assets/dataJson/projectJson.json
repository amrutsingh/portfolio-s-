    "description": "I developed a web portal called Kanban Board using React JS and Spring Boot. The goal of the project was to create a tool that could manage and assign work to team members, and be reviewed and managed by the admin and managers. The frontend of the portal was developed using React JS, while the RESTFul APIs were developed using Spring Boot. With this web portal, users can easily track and organize their work, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and effectively. The Kanban Board is a valuable resource for teams looking to streamline their workflow and increase productivity.",

The application, built using React JS, features a page that showcases the company's services and includes customer testimonials. I also implemented a blog panel that allows the admin to easily post and manage multiple blogs. The goal of the project was to create a professional and engaging website for Takniik that effectively communicates the company's offerings and establishes its credibility in the industry. I worked closely with the client to understand their needs and ensure that the final product met their expectations. Overall, the project was a success and the client was very satisfied with the result.",
