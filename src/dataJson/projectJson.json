Also, the client wants the zig-zag pattern architecture for his portfolio so that users can read about the experience and also check the image side by side so according to that, I have designed this wonderful zig-zag pattern about section and experience with cards where all the services are mentioned that client provides. As per the compliment I have implemented the telegram bot that sends the contact information that users entered in the contact form directly to the client's telegram account.",
