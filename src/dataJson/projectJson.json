    "description": "Designed and developed a landing page for a Burger Shop who wants to display their product details on the landing page.\nThe client wants a minimal design with a BIG image of a burger on the top, so I displayed a big burger image on the top inside an egg-shaped vessel.\nAlso displayed their products under the products section and created a wonderful gallery of images under the photos section.",
